# cx-smartSeats
allocate seats to flight passengers based on their personal preference

Make a seat arrangement platforms for cathay pacific aircrafts based on the personalities of passangers
Talkative people would be suggested to sit beside others who want to engage in coversations
People who prefer to rest, read a book, watch a movie or do things in silence, would be suggested to sit beside others who are quiet

We use Breadth First Search (BFS) to produce heat maps of areas filled with talkative and silent people
